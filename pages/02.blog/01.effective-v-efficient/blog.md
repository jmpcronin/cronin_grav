There is something about the slower pace of summer that puts me in a reflective mood. Peter Drucker's quote about efficiency versus effectiveness is niggling at me. As we make things more complex, whether it be education or technology, I see a whole lot of energy being spent in what is efficient. It is only in rare circumstances is there a concern for whether we are being effective. Are do we doing the right thing. It reminds of an old Yogi Berra story. He got lost on the way to the Baseball Hall of Fame. His wife was giving him a hard time. He rebuffed her saying, "Sure we're lost, but we are making good time!"
