When we are rushed, bored, or tired we become less tolerant of uncertainty. I might even throw hunger onto that list. Whenever there are more demands on our system, we demand certainty. Where will we eat, when will it be done, when will this be over? Travel, reading, new languages and cultures, new experiences in general help increase that tolerance for uncertainty.
