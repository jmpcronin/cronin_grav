### Sensible Defaults

This is a list of the products in my life that I no longer need to consider. This is not a buyerʻs guide, just a glimpse at my choices. They are not luxury items by any stretch they work well enough and allow me to find flow in what I am doing. If you have any suggestions, let me know. For now, this is what I have:

- Pen: Pentel EnerGel X .5MM 
- Pencil: Staedtler Norica HB #2
- Notebook: Field Notes Grid / Dot Paper or Moleskin Graph
- Socks: Darn Tough Light Crew, Charcoal
- Coffee: Peet’s Major Dickerson’s Blend w/ AeroPress
- Small Utility Tool: Leatherman Squirt PS4 Multitool
- Headphones: AirPods 
- Water Bottle: Kleen Kanteen Insulated Wide Mouth

#### Software:
- Writing: Ulysses
- To Do: OmniFocus and Things (… and Reminders)


Patrick Rhone introduced the world to the idea of [sensible defaults] back in 2010 and adapted from [Jacoby Young].
